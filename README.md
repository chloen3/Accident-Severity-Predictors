# Demographic, Substance, and Environmental Factors in Predicting Accident Severity

## Project Report by: Chloe Nicola, Audric Charles, Divy Shah, David Zhao

## Abstract
This study investigates environmental, demographic, and substance-related factors in predicting traffic accident severity in the City of Tempe. Using a dataset of over 35,000 crash records, we analyzed variables such as weather conditions, lighting, surface quality, and driver demographics to assess their impact on crash outcomes. Statistical techniques such as Welchâ€™s ANOVA and hypothesis testing were employed to evaluate differences in injury severity.

Our findings highlight adverse weather conditions (e.g., fog, snow), drug-impaired driving, and older drivers (75+ years) as significant predictors of higher accident severity. Certain high-traffic streets, such as Baseline Road and Rural Road, emerged as consistent hotspots for severe crashes. These results emphasize the need for targeted interventions, including infrastructure improvements and campaigns against drug-impaired driving.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of over 35,000 crash records with details on:
- **Crash information:** Type, contributing factors, and severity.
- **Environmental factors:** Weather, lighting, and road surface conditions.
- **Driver demographics:** Age, gender, and substance use.
- **Location details:** Coordinates, street names, and junction presence.

---

## Key Findings
- **Substance Influence:** Drug-related crashes result in higher fatalities and injuries than alcohol-related crashes.
- **Environmental Factors:** Snow, fog, wet, and icy roads significantly elevate crash severity.
- **Demographic Factors:** Older drivers (75+) are at higher risk, while gender differences are minimal.
- **Geographic Factors:** High-traffic roads such as Baseline Road and Rural Road are frequent accident hotspots.

## Future Work
- **Deeper analysis of substance use:** Investigate the effects of specific drugs on crash severity.
- **Enhanced demographic modeling:** Explore how age affects crash outcomes.
- **Advanced machine learning approaches:** Use predictive models to better forecast accident severity.
- **Policy recommendations:** Implement awareness campaigns and infrastructure improvements.
